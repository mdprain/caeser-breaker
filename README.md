# Caeser Breaker
A simple Python script to break a Caeser cipher of any shift, using a wordlist from https://github.com/powerlanguage/word-lists

(Nothing really fancy, I know. But I figured I should add another public item to my GitHub account.)

# How To Use
Basically, just replace the "message" variable with your encoded text, then run the script - simple!
